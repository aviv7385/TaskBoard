# TaskBoard
The first project I submitted for Fullstack Web Developement class in John Bryce college.
The idea of this project was to create a task board, kind of to-do list, by using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
This project wraps up the front-end materials of this course.
=========================
About the project:

>> The user can type any task they need to do into the 
text-area, and can also add a due-date and due-time 
for the task.

>> In the form there are two buttons - submit and reset. 
The "Reset" clears the form fields and the "submit" 
fires up a validation function which validates that 
the input in the text-area is a valid text and that 
the user entered a date. The time input is optional.

>> Once validated - the task will be save into the local 
storage and will show up on a "post-it" note on the screen.

>> Each new task will be added to the local storage 
and will get its own post-it note. 

>> If the user wants to remove one of the notes, all they 
need to do is get the mouse over the note, and a "clear" 
button will appear (used a Glyphicon from Bootstrap 3 for that). 
When moving the mouse of the note - the clear button disappears.

>> Upon pressing that clear button - the post-it note will 
disappear and the task will be deleted from the local storage.

>> When loading the page, all the saved tasks will be displayed.
